TN-EV-Charging

Capstone project for Part Time Data Analytics Cohort 5 at Nashville Software School.

In this project I seek to compare the prevalence, ease of access, and usefulness for daily as well as long distance travel of public electric vehicle (EV) charging networks compared to the existing petroleum fuel station network in my home state of Tennessee.

Motivation

I have been interested in EV’s and alternative energy in general (non fossil fuel) for a long time. With the rise of Tesla, and the rapid refocusing of larger legacy car manufacturers to EV technology and away from fossil fuel technology, I am convinced that EV adoption is happening at a much faster pace than most people realize. One crucial factor in widespread adoption of EV’s is easy access to charging infrastructure for everyone both for local commuting and for long trips. The existing gas station network, with over a century of development behind it, is the hallmark of convenience and widespread availability for vehicle fuels.


This is still a work in progress.
